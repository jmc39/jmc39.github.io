            <p>In this scatterplot, latitude is along the x-axis and wind speed (measured in miles per hour) along the y-axis. For data from January 5, 2017, this plot indicates a pattern that establishes a relationship between latitude vs. windspeed Across the range of latitudes above and below the equatorwind speed tends to be less than 5 mph.
